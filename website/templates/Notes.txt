A template in Flask is basically an HTML file that Flask can send to the browser. 

In the template folder: 
1. We have HTML files. 
2. Each are made for the pages we want. 
3. Let's say we have a loggin page
4. We need a login html class, with its JS and CSS stuff. 

5. So since everytime we need to crete these files for multiply files, we create a base.html file. 

6. base.html --> ACTS as a teamplate.
