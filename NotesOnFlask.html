        <h2>Flask Project Structure – Summary</h2>

        <p>
        This Flask project follows the <strong>Application Factory Pattern</strong> and uses
        <strong>Blueprints</strong> to keep the code organized, modular, and scalable.
        Instead of putting everything in one file, each part of the application
        has a clear responsibility.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Structure</h3>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>main.py</strong> – Entry point of the application. It creates and runs the Flask app.</li>
        <li><strong>website/</strong> – The main application package.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>__init__.py</strong> – Creates the Flask app and registers Blueprints.</li>
            <li><strong>views.py</strong> – Contains routes for general pages (e.g., home page).</li>
            <li><strong>auth.py</strong> – Contains routes related to authentication (login, signup, logout).</li>
            <li><strong>models.py</strong> – Defines database models (used later).</li>
            <li><strong>templates/</strong> – Holds HTML files rendered by Flask.</li>
            <li><strong>static/</strong> – Holds CSS, JavaScript, and images.</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Application Factory Pattern</h3>

        <p>
        The Flask app is created inside a function called <code>create_app()</code>.
        This allows the application to be configured and assembled in one place,
        making it easier to scale, test, and manage as the project grows.
        </p>

        <p>
        The <code>SECRET_KEY</code> is set inside this function to enable sessions,
        cookies, and authentication features.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Blueprints</h3>

        <p>
        Blueprints allow routes to be grouped by functionality.
        Each Blueprint defines routes but does not create the Flask app itself.
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>views Blueprint</strong> – Handles general pages such as the home page.</li>
        <li><strong>auth Blueprint</strong> – Handles authentication-related pages.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Blueprints are registered inside <code>create_app()</code>, which connects all routes to the main app.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Request Flow</h3>

        <ol>
        <li>The application starts in <code>main.py</code>.</li>
        <li><code>create_app()</code> creates the Flask app.</li>
        <li>Blueprints are registered.</li>
        <li>A user visits a URL.</li>
        <li>Flask finds the matching route inside a Blueprint.</li>
        <li>The route function runs and returns a response.</li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h3>Key Idea</h3>

        <p>
        This structure separates concerns, keeps files small and readable,
        and prepares the application for future features such as databases,
        authentication, and larger codebases.
